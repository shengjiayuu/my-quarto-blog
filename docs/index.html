      <h1>Welcome to Python Data Science Tutorial</h1>
      <p>In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps of using Python to train a machine learning model to predict outcomes based on data. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, this guide will help you get started with Python and machine learning.</p>
      <p>Python has become the go-to programming language for data science. Its simplicity and powerful libraries such as <code>pandas</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>scikit-learn</code> have made it the preferred language for data analysts and machine learning engineers. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, Python offers tools to perform data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization with minimal effort.</p>
      <p>Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), has revolutionized many industries, including healthcare, finance, and marketing. By using historical data, machine learning algorithms make predictions about future events. With Python, machine learning becomes more accessible, even for beginners, thanks to its user-friendly syntax and powerful libraries. In this tutorial, we will break down the process of training a model in Python into clear, manageable steps so that you can replicate it in your own projects.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries</h2>
      <p>Before we begin, let's make sure you have the required libraries installed. You will need <code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>pandas</code> for this tutorial. These libraries are widely used in the data science community and provide a simple yet powerful interface to build machine learning models and perform data analysis.</p>
      <p>To install the libraries, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:</p>
      <pre><code>pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas</code></pre>
      <p>Once the libraries are installed, we are ready to proceed with the next step — importing them into our Python script.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Import Libraries</h2>
      <p>Now that the necessary libraries are installed, let's import them into our Python script. Each library has a specific purpose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>pandas</code>: for data manipulation and cleaning.</li>
        <li><code>scikit-learn</code>: for machine learning tasks like splitting data, training models, and evaluating performance.</li>
        <li><code>matplotlib</code>: for visualizing data and model results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s how you can import these libraries:</p>
      <pre><code>
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Prepare the Data</h2>
      <p>Data preparation is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. This step involves loading the dataset, selecting features, and splitting it into training and testing sets. In this example, we’ll assume you already have a dataset in a CSV file, but you can easily adapt this tutorial to work with other formats such as Excel or SQL databases.</p>
      <p>Let's start by loading the data using <code>pandas</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Load the data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
      </code></pre>
      <p>Once the data is loaded, we’ll separate it into the input features (X) and the target variable (y). In most machine learning problems, the goal is to predict the target variable (y) based on the input features (X), so we need to isolate them accordingly:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Separate features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
      </code></pre>
      <p>In this step, we are also splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. We use 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This allows us to evaluate how well our model generalizes to unseen data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4: Train the Machine Learning Model</h2>
      <p>Now that the data is ready, we can train a Random Forest model using the <code>scikit-learn</code> library. Random Forest is a versatile machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by constructing a number of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the majority vote of the trees (for classification problems).</p>
      <p>Let’s initialize the model and train it on the training data:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Initialize the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 5: Evaluate the Model</h2>
      <p>Once the model is trained, we can evaluate its performance by comparing the predicted values with the actual values from the test set. A common metric used for classification problems is accuracy, which tells us the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to evaluate the model using accuracy:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 6: Visualize Feature Importance</h2>
      <p>After evaluating the model, it's important to understand which features contributed the most to the model’s predictions. Random Forest models provide a way to compute feature importance, which can help us better interpret the model and identify key drivers of the target variable.</p>
      <p>Let’s visualize the feature importance using a horizontal bar chart:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.barh(X.columns, model.feature_importances_)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.show()
      </code></pre>
