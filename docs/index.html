      <h2>Experience and Motivation</h2>
      <p>Jessica is comfortable using a computer for everyday activities like socializing, studying, and taking photos. However, she has no technical experience with programming languages like Python and hasn’t explored coding before.</p>
      <p>Jessica wants to learn Python to enhance her skills and maybe create her own projects, such as small apps or automation scripts. She’s curious about how programming can make everyday tasks easier and more fun. Her goal is to start with basic Python concepts and gradually understand how to write simple programs to impress her friends and solve practical problems in her daily life.</p>

      <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
      <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install necessary libraries for machine learning and data science in Python.</li>
        <li>Prepare and clean data for training a machine learning model.</li>
        <li>Train a Random Forest classifier using `scikit-learn`.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the model’s performance.</li>
        <li>Visualize the feature importance of the model.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries</h2>
      <p>Before we begin, let's make sure you have the required libraries installed. You will need `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:</p>
      <pre><code>pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Import Libraries</h2>
      <p>Once you have the libraries installed, import them in your Python script as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Prepare the Data</h2>
      <p>Now, let’s load a dataset and prepare it for model training. We’ll use the `pandas` library to read a CSV file and then split it into features (X) and the target (y).</p>
      <pre><code>
# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4: Train the Machine Learning Model</h2>
      <p>Next, we’ll train a Random Forest classifier using the training data.</p>
      <pre><code>
# Initialize the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 5: Evaluate the Model</h2>
      <p>Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance using accuracy. Let’s make predictions on the test set and calculate the accuracy score:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 6: Visualize Feature Importance</h2>
      <p>Now, let’s visualize the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable using the trained Random Forest model:</p>
      <pre><code>
# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.barh(X.columns, model.feature_importances_)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.show()
      </code></pre>
